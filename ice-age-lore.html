      <h1>Ice Age Lore</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to Dominaria during the <strong>Time of Ice</strong>—an era so long and so cold that history itself
        starts to blur at the edges. Most worlds forget their dark ages. Dominaria froze inside one.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Ice Age lasted from <strong>450 AR to 2934 AR</strong>: more than two thousand years of hard winter,
        short summers, hungry magic, and civilizations shaped by endurance. Most people assume it was quiet.
        It wasn’t. It was simply <em>hidden</em>—under snow, under myth, and under the influence of powers
        that preferred the world not to remember too clearly.
      </p>

      <h2>The spark that broke the weather</h2>
      <p>
        The cold wasn’t just “nature being rude.” The Ice Age was set in motion by the catastrophic
        <strong>Sylex Blast</strong> at the end of the Brothers’ War—an event so vast it echoed through the plane’s
        climate and mana. Over time, the freeze deepened… and then it lingered far longer than it should have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why did it last? Because planeswalkers meddled. The Ice Age became a board where ancient mages moved pieces:
        <strong>Leshrac</strong> and <strong>Tevesh Szat</strong> worked their own designs, while others—like
        <strong>Freyalise</strong> and <strong>Kristina of the Woods</strong>—fought to keep life and hope from
        snapping under the pressure.
      </p>

      <h2>The Shard of Twelve Worlds</h2>
      <p>
        As if the cold weren’t enough, the Sylex’s aftershocks helped form a planar barrier called the
        <strong>Shard of Twelve Worlds</strong>. Think of it like a cosmic snowglobe: travel into and out of this
        pocket of the Multiverse became difficult or impossible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Several planeswalkers were trapped within the Shard, while others—most famously Urza—were locked out.
        The result? Terisiare became a stage with the doors bolted shut. The powers already inside could
        scheme without outside interference… and the people below had to survive whatever “game” the immortals played.
      </p>

      <h2>Terisiare: a continent remade by ice</h2>
      <p>
        The heart of this campaign is <strong>Terisiare</strong>, where glaciers didn’t just arrive—they reorganized
        the map.
      </p>

      <h3>The great walls of ice</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Great Glacier</strong> filled the Lat-Nam Straits and locked old coastlines into new shapes,
          cutting regions off behind sheer ice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ronom Glacier</strong>—Terisiare’s first and most infamous—expanded south until even ancient deserts
          became a bleak memory, renamed the <strong>Northern Wastes</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Raynor Glacier</strong> pressed down from the east, eventually swallowing the once-proud city of
          <strong>Storgard</strong> under tons of ice.
        </li>
        <li>
          The far north became the <strong>Boreal</strong>, a place so harsh it felt less like land and more like
          a warning.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Where people went when the world stopped being polite</h3>
      <p>
        As old kingdoms failed, new nations hardened into shape:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Kjeldor</strong> rose from the remnants of older settlements, built by survivors who chose
          discipline and grit over surrender.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Balduvia</strong> endured as fierce clans and warriors carved a life out of wind and snow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fyndhorn</strong> emerged as the seas lowered and new land rose—briefly fertile, strangely hopeful,
          and fated to change again when the ice finally broke.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hidden sanctuaries of magic</h3>
      <p>
        Magic didn’t vanish in the Ice Age. It refined. It became deliberate—more studied, more desperate,
        and more secretive.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <strong>School of the Unseen</strong> was founded as a hidden refuge for spellcasters after older
          strongholds were lost to advancing ice.
        </li>
        <li>
          The city of <strong>Soldev</strong> rose amid ruins and ambition—part ingenuity, part obsession.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Storgard falls, Kjeldor rises</h2>
      <p>
        One of the defining tragedies of the Ice Age was the <strong>Fall of Storgard</strong>.
        With Raynor Glacier closing in and corruption at the top, the city fractured: some fled south,
        refusing to be entombed with their pride. Those refugees laid the foundations for what would become
        <strong>Kjeld</strong>, heart of Kjeldor.
      </p>

      <p>
        This pattern repeats across Terisiare: old names vanish under snow, and new names appear where survivors
        decide to stop running.
      </p>

      <h2>The late Ice Age: proxy wars and ancient debts</h2>
      <p>
        Near the end, the Ice Age stops feeling like “just winter” and starts feeling like a bill coming due.
        Mortal factions clash, but the shadows behind them are longer than the people casting them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The necromancer <strong>Lim-Dûl</strong> becomes a central threat, and the final conflicts of the era gather
        mages, leaders, and legends into one last decisive struggle—later remembered as the <strong>Last Battlefield</strong>.
        The Ice Age doesn’t end with a whimper; it ends with a turning point.
      </p>

      <h2>The Summit of the Null Moon</h2>
      <p>
        Planeswalkers gathered on the <strong>Null Moon</strong> to discuss the Shard and their imprisonment within it.
        Of course, “discuss” is what you call it when immortal beings attempt diplomacy while quietly checking for
        knives behind backs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The summit didn’t neatly solve the Shard… but it helped set the final answer in motion:
        a decision that would take power on the scale of the disaster that started this whole mess.
      </p>

      <h2>The World Spell: ending the Time of Ice</h2>
      <p>
        In <strong>2934 AR</strong>, <strong>Freyalise</strong> cast the <strong>World Spell</strong>, breaking the Shard
        and ending the Ice Age. This wasn’t a gentle spring thaw. It was a reality-level correction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The era that followed is called <strong>The Thaw</strong>—and it brought its own problems. When millennia of ice
        finally retreat, the world doesn’t politely return to normal. It floods, collapses, reshapes coastlines, and
        forces entire peoples to migrate again.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this matters for ElderForge</h2>
      <p>
        ElderForge: Ice Age is set in the last stretch of the freeze, when hope exists but feels expensive.
        Civilizations are tough, magic is precious, and every ruin is both a shelter and a temptation.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re not just learning spells—you’re stepping into a continent where history is literally buried.
        Every expedition is a gamble between <strong>survival</strong>, <strong>power</strong>, and the kind of
        knowledge that should probably stay under the snow.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick timeline (for your brain’s map)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brothers’ War ends</strong> → Sylex Blast scars the world and its mana.</li>
        <li><strong>450 AR</strong> → Ice Age is considered “fully begun” across Terisiare.</li>
        <li><strong>~400 AR</strong> → Shard of Twelve Worlds finishes forming; planeswalker travel is disrupted.</li>
        <li><strong>Storgard falls</strong> → refugees establish the roots of Kjeldor.</li>
        <li><strong>2934 AR</strong> → Summit of the Null Moon; endgame maneuvers begin.</li>
        <li><strong>2934 AR</strong> → World Spell ends the Ice Age and breaks the Shard.</li>
        <li><strong>The Thaw</strong> → flooding and reshaping of Terisiare follows.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Starter mindset for a new player</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The cold is the setting, not the villain.</strong> The real danger is what people do when survival is tight.</li>
        <li><strong>Ruin means story.</strong> If a place has a name, something happened there—something worth digging up.</li>
        <li><strong>Magic is scarce and sharp.</strong> The Ice Age doesn’t make mages weaker; it makes them precise.</li>
      </ul>
