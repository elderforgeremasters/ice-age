      <h1>World Lore</h1>

      <p>
        Dominaria is an Earthlike world—spherical, with broad continents and oceans under a familiar sun—and it has two moons:
        the natural <strong>Mist Moon</strong> and the artificial <strong>Null Moon</strong>. In the Ice Age, that sun often feels muted behind heavy cloud
        and endless snowfall, so daylight turns pale and grudging, as if the world is rationing warmth.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the <strong>Shard of Twelve Worlds</strong> era, people still see the moons rise and the seasons inch along, but many swear the sky feels wrong:
        planar travel is choked off and the world’s metaphysics feel “sealed,” which makes strange omens plausible and persuasive—auroras sharper than they should be,
        constellations that seem oddly fixed in certain regions, and cult whispers that the Null Moon is watching rather than merely orbiting.
      </p>

      <p>
        They called it the <strong>Ice Age</strong> — the <strong>Time of Ice</strong>, the <strong>Time of the Eternal Snows</strong>.
        A winter so long it stopped being weather and became history. Terisiare didn’t merely grow colder.
        It was reshaped, renamed, and rerouted by ice until the continent itself felt like a maze built to test survival.
      </p>

      <div class="loreSec">
        <h2>1–2) The world starts freezing, and Terisiare is remade by ice</h2>

        <div class="loreCard loreCard--right">
          <figure>
            <img src="cards/778-Island-of-Lat-Nam.webp" alt="Island of Lat-Nam" />
            <figcaption><strong>Island of Lat-Nam</strong> — the Great Glacier turns waterways into walls and coastlines into history.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          The cold had been creeping in for centuries, but the true turning point came after the <strong>Sylex Blast</strong> that ended the Brothers’ War.
          The blast scarred Dominaria’s mana and climate, and the decline accelerated. Within a few generations, the Ice Age is considered fully begun:
          institutions collapse, borders harden, and the snow stops behaving like something temporary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glaciers advance like empires. The <strong>Great Glacier</strong> fills the Lat-Nam Straits, binding old coastlines into new shapes while sealing regions
          behind sheer walls of ice. As the freeze deepens, Terisiare becomes a new continent wearing old bones: <strong>Ronom Glacier</strong> expands south until even
          the long-abandoned Great Desert is effectively erased and remembered as the <strong>Northern Wastes</strong>. Lakes stop flowing. Valleys become traps.
          A place that once gave life becomes a place that steals it — <strong>Ronom Lake</strong> turns into the deadly swamp called the <strong>Frost Marsh</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whole societies adjust. Old city-states fade. New peoples harden into nations: the <strong>Kjeldorans</strong> build for discipline and endurance;
          the <strong>Balduvians</strong> survive through fierce mobility and will. In the east, forests fed by glacial waters defy the freeze —
          and the seed of what becomes <strong>Yavimaya</strong> proves the world still remembers how to grow.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="loreSec">
        <h2>3–4) Hidden refuges of magic, and the Shard of Twelve Worlds</h2>

        <div class="loreCard loreCard--left">

            <img src="cards/524-School-of-the-Unseen.webp" alt="School of the Unseen" />
            <figcaption><strong>School of the Unseen</strong> — scholarship and spellcraft retreat into secrecy as the world grows hostile.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Civilization doesn’t stop — it goes underground, behind wards, into secrecy. When the <strong>City of Shadows</strong> is abandoned, scholars flee and eventually
          establish the <strong>School of the Unseen</strong>: a hidden campus and sanctuary for spellcasters, built to endure when ordinary cities cannot. Elsewhere,
          ambition takes a different shape. On the ruins of old Kroog, <strong>Soldev</strong> rises — a place where invention and obsession share the same workshop.
          In the Ice Age, “progress” is never clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the world gets smaller. As a side-effect of the Sylex Blast, the Multiverse around Dominaria is wrapped into an envelope called the
          <strong>Shard of Twelve Worlds</strong>. Travel into or out of this pocket becomes impossible or severely limited. Some of the oldest powers are trapped within.
          Others are locked out. Terisiare is now a stage with the doors bolted shut — and when the exits vanish, even ordinary omens can become persuasive.
        </p>

        <h2>5) Storgard falls, Kjeldor rises</h2>

        <div class="loreCard loreCard--right">

            <img src="cards/860-Storgard.webp" alt="Storgard" />
            <figcaption><strong>Storgard</strong> — a proud seat undone by ice, corruption, and a single irrevocable choice.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Centuries pass. The Ice Age grinds on. Then comes one of its defining tragedies: the <strong>Fall of Storgard</strong>. The <strong>Raynor Glacier</strong> presses
          down upon the city, and the corruption of King Miko by <strong>Tevesh Szat</strong> twists leadership when clarity is most needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Storgard fractures over a single question: stay, or flee? The decision is put to a duel between <strong>Jason Carthalion</strong> and <strong>Freyalise</strong>
          (before her ascension). Jason wins — and those who choose to leave are spared the fate of the city. The refugees settle upon the ruins of old Penregon and found
          <strong>Kjeld</strong>. What begins as flight becomes a nation: <strong>Kjeldor</strong>. Those who remain are eventually swallowed by the glacier and erased.
          The Ice Age doesn’t just kill — it removes the evidence.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="loreSec">
        <h2>6) The late Ice Age tightens: secrets, proxies, and a final convergence</h2>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          By the end of the era, Terisiare is a continent full of hardened nations and refined magic — but also a place where great powers still cast long shadows.
          The Shard remains. The cold remains. Conflicts increasingly feel like proxy wars: mortals fighting while larger hands steer the pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those hands gather at the <strong>Summit of the Null Moon</strong> to discuss breaking the Shard, but the meeting is poisoned by private agendas.
          Death strikes: the Elder Dragon <strong>Chromium Rhuell</strong> dies, and Faralyn’s spellsquire <strong>Ravidel</strong> is killed and resurrected —
          a kindness that drives him into fury and madness. The summit fails to end the Shard, but it plants the final idea that will.

        <h2>7) Lim-Dûl’s Battle: the Last Battlefield</h2>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          In that same late span, Terisiare erupts into its final great war. The necromancer <strong>Lim-Dûl</strong> brings an undead host through the Karplusan passes,
          and the defenders gather at the mouth of a mountain route north of Krov. <strong>Lovisa Coldeyes</strong> leads Balduvia. <strong>General Varchild</strong> leads
          Kjeldor. Mages fight openly: <strong>Jodah</strong> the archmage, <strong>Jaya Ballard</strong> the taskmage, and others whose names become welded to the era’s ending.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the climax, Jodah duels Lim-Dûl. Lim-Dûl calls on <strong>Leshrac</strong> for aid — and Leshrac arrives, not to save him, but to express disappointment.
          Leshrac severs Lim-Dûl’s hand, breaks his connection to Mairsil’s ring, and planeswalks away with him. The site becomes known as the <strong>Last Battlefield</strong>:
          the last war fought during the Ice Age.

        <h2>8–9) The World Spell, and the Thaw that follows</h2>

        <div class="loreCard loreCard--left">

            <img src="cards/867-The-World-Spell.webp" alt="The World Spell" />

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Immediately after Lim-Dûl’s defeat, <strong>Freyalise</strong> acts. She casts the <strong>World Spell</strong> to break the Shard and end the Ice Age.
          The ritual uses the <strong>Ice Cauldron</strong> (a replica of the Sylex) and <strong>Jodah’s mirror</strong>, used to “show the land its true self.”
          The spell’s power is on par with the Sylex Blast — potentially devastating — so its force is dispersed across Terisiare via safe havens that are destroyed
          in the process. The world survives the cure. The cure leaves scars. And the ice finally loosens its grip.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next era is called <strong>The Thaw</strong>, but it begins with a betrayal of expectations: warmth doesn’t arrive as peace — it arrives as water.
          As the <strong>Great Glacier</strong>, <strong>Ronom Glacier</strong>, <strong>Raynor Glacier</strong>, and the Boreal ice retreat, meltwater reshapes the continent.
          The <strong>Sea of Laments</strong> forms, drowning regions and splitting Terisiare into the Terisian Isles. Peoples are displaced again. Lands are reclaimed, then lost,
          then claimed once more. The Thaw is not epilogue — it is the second catastrophe.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="loreSec">
        <h2>10) Alliances: when buried machines wake</h2>

        <div class="loreCard loreCard--right">

            <img src="cards/785-Jodah-Alliance-Architect.webp" alt="Jodah, Alliance Architect" />
            <figcaption><strong>Jodah</strong> — careful alliances and desperate measures when ending an era demanded more than courage.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Not long into the Thaw, the melting ice reveals what should have stayed buried. In <strong>Soldev</strong>, the Soldevi Adnates pry open locked vaults.
          <strong>Arcum Dagsson</strong> commands wonders — but wonders are not always loyal. Excavated <strong>Phyrexian War Beasts</strong> are activated, and Soldevi Steam Beasts
          are turned into weapons. Soldev is destroyed in a storm of machinery and magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the aftermath, the catastrophe spills into the <strong>School of the Unseen</strong>, drawn toward a deep source of black mana — a bottomless pit tied to darker forces.
          The School, long a refuge, is shattered. Survivors scatter. Jodah fades into myth. Jaya’s power erupts and changes her forever.
        </p>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Even after the World Spell, the cold refuses to die politely. Movements rise that want the world frozen again. The <strong>Cult of Rimewind</strong> becomes a force —
          not a place, but an ideology armed with undead, orcs, Stromgald influence, and whatever war-machines the melt coughs up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kjeldor fights again in the early Thaw, not merely against enemies on the field, but against the idea that the past can be revived if enough people fear the future.
          The Ice Age ends — and then has one more argument about it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:2rem">
        That’s the record: a world frozen by ancient disaster, sealed by planar consequence, hardened into nations, shaken by necromancy and machines, cracked open by a spell
        powerful enough to end an era — and then tested again by those who refused to let winter go.
