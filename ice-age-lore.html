      <h1>Ice Age Lore</h1>

      <p>
        They called it the <strong>Time of Ice</strong>. The <strong>Time of the Eternal Snows</strong>.
        Not because it was poetic — because it was accurate. Winter stopped being a season and became
        the atmosphere of life itself. Generations were born under gray skies, lived under gray skies,
        and died never knowing whether the world had ever been warm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most people assume such a long age must have been quiet. It wasn’t quiet. It was simply hard to record.
        Paper freezes. Roads vanish. Cities get swallowed. And when history is buried under ice,
        rumor becomes scripture.
      </p>

      <h2>The first sin: the blast that bent the world</h2>
      <p>
        The freeze was not “natural.” It began in the deep shadow of an older catastrophe: the <strong>Sylex Blast</strong>
        at the end of the Brothers’ War. The world had already been cooling for centuries, but after the blast,
        Terisiare’s climate crossed a line and kept falling. By <strong>450 AR</strong>, the cold had a grip on the whole
        continent strong enough that old institutions collapsed and people stopped pretending it would pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Glaciers advanced like invading nations. The <strong>Great Glacier</strong> filled the Lat-Nam Straits and bound
        old coastlines into new shapes — and also cut regions off behind sheer walls of ice. The <strong>City of Shadows</strong>
        was abandoned. So was Penregon, long before. When the snow comes for your home, you do not argue with it.
        You pack what you can and pray you find land that still remembers how to be land.
      </p>

      <h2>The continent becomes a maze</h2>
      <p>
        As the ice moved, it didn’t just cover Terisiare — it rearranged it.
        <strong>Ronom Glacier</strong> expanded south until even the long-abandoned Great Desert became a bleak memory,
        renamed the <strong>Northern Wastes</strong>. Mountains were trapped and renamed by their new reality. Lakes stopped
        flowing. A place that had been water became a place that wanted you dead: <strong>Ronom Lake</strong> turned into the
        <strong>Frost Marsh</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the east, the old city-states faded and were replaced by a hard people who built hard cities:
        the <strong>Kjeldorans</strong>. Their capital, <strong>Kjeld</strong>, rose on the ruins of earlier failure — because history
        in Terisiare repeats, only colder. Further south, <strong>Krov</strong> took root along the river, living in the tension between
        trade, war, and hunger.
      </p>

      <p>
        And on the shore by the ruins of old Kroog, something impossible happened. A forest began thriving on glacial water.
        The world proved it still knew how to grow. That forest was <strong>Yavimaya</strong> — a green defiance so strong it would shape
        Dominaria for ages.
      </p>

      <h2>The second sin: the world gets locked</h2>
      <p>
        As if the cold weren’t enough, the Sylex’s aftershocks helped form something stranger: the
        <strong>Shard of Twelve Worlds</strong> — an envelope of planes cut off from the wider Multiverse.
        Travel into or out of the Shard became nearly impossible. Planeswalkers were trapped inside it,
        and others were locked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Terisiare, already frozen, became something worse: a stage with the doors bolted shut.
        Powers that were supposed to be distant or rare could now linger, meddle, and play long games.
        Names that matter in this era include <strong>Leshrac</strong> and <strong>Tevesh Szat</strong> —
        forces whose influence can be felt in the way whole nations move, fracture, and fight.
      </p>

      <h2>Storgard: the lesson the ice teaches everyone</h2>
      <p>
        One of the defining tragedies of the Ice Age was the fall of <strong>Storgard</strong>.
        With the <strong>Raynor Glacier</strong> pressing down and corruption gnawing at leadership, the city faced a choice:
        flee, or stay and be entombed with pride.
      </p>

      <p>
        The refugees who left — including figures like <strong>Jason Carthalion</strong> and <strong>Oriel Kjeldos</strong> —
        traveled south and founded what would become Kjeldor’s heart. Those who stayed behind were swallowed by ice,
        erased so thoroughly that later generations could treat Storgard as a cautionary myth.
        That’s the Ice Age’s favorite trick: it turns real deaths into “legends” because no one wants to remember the details.
      </p>

      <h2>The quiet protagonists</h2>
      <p>
        The Ice Age’s story is not only glaciers and borders. It’s people. Not all of them are kings.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Jodah</strong> moves through this era as a scholar and archmage, the kind history tries to keep in footnotes
        until he becomes unavoidable. <strong>Jaya Ballard</strong> is the opposite: raw fire, personality, and refusal —
        the kind of mage the Ice Age produces when it pushes too hard. And in the north, <strong>Lovisa Coldeyes</strong>
        stands as Balduvia’s spearpoint: a leader whose name survives because her people do.
      </p>

      <h2>The Last Battlefield: Lim-Dûl’s war comes due</h2>
      <p>
        Near the end of the Ice Age, the necromancer <strong>Lim-Dûl</strong> becomes the threat that turns fear into mobilization.
        His forces had numbers, patience, and the most unfair advantage imaginable in a frozen world: the dead do not feel cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final great clash took place at a mountain pass north of Krov, later remembered as the <strong>Last Battlefield</strong>.
        The <strong>Kjeldorans</strong> and <strong>Balduvians</strong> gathered there under leaders like <strong>Varchild</strong> and
        <strong>Lovisa Coldeyes</strong>. Mages fought in the open: <strong>Jodah</strong> with precision, <strong>Jaya</strong> with fire,
        and others whose names became anchors for the last days of the freeze.
      </p>

      <p>
        The battle is remembered not only for armies but for the sense that larger powers were using mortals as pieces —
        a “proxy war” in the shadow of planeswalkers. Lim-Dûl himself was ultimately removed from the plane when the planeswalker
        <strong>Leshrac</strong> severed his connection to the power that sustained him and took him away.
        The Ice Age did not end because evil politely lost. It ended because the board was flipped.
      </p>

      <h2>The Summit of the Null Moon</h2>
      <p>
        Around the same time, planeswalkers gathered on the <strong>Null Moon</strong> to discuss what to do about the Shard —
        the planar prison they were trapped within. It was presented as cooperation. It was also manipulation.
        Death and betrayal circled the meeting like wolves.
      </p>

      <p>
        The summit did not neatly solve the problem. But it created the final spark of insight:
        a way to end the Shard and the Ice Age with a spell whose power echoed the disaster that began it.
      </p>

      <h2>The World Spell: spring arrives like a weapon</h2>
      <p>
        In <strong>2934 AR</strong>, <strong>Freyalise</strong> cast the <strong>World Spell</strong>, breaking the Shard and ending the Ice Age.
        It wasn’t “gentle warmth returning.” It was a reality-level correction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ritual involved the <strong>Ice Cauldron</strong> (a constructed echo of the Sylex) and <strong>Jodah’s mirror</strong>,
        used to “show the land its true self.” The power released could have devastated Terisiare — but it was dispersed,
        and safe havens were destroyed in the process. The world survived the cure, but the cure left scars.
      </p>

      <h2>The Thaw and Alliances: the flood age and the breaking of old certainties</h2>
      <p>
        Then came the part people never imagine when they wish for the end of winter: the melt.
        When millennia of ice finally retreat, the world doesn’t return to normal. It <strong>floods</strong>.
        Terisiare reshapes itself into something new and jagged.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meltwaters carved and drowned the land. Seas formed where plains had been. Regions that existed for generations
        were lost. Peoples were displaced. Some fled into <strong>Yavimaya</strong> and made uneasy peace with what lived there.
        New nations rose in warmer soil. Old ones became ruins, then reefs.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where <strong>Alliances</strong> lives: in the chaos of transition, when buried things reappear and everyone rushes to claim them.
        The thaw did not end conflict — it multiplied it.
      </p>

      <h2>Soldev and the School of the Unseen: when buried machines wake up</h2>
      <p>
        In the aftermath, ambition turned deadly. In <strong>Soldev</strong>, secretive groups dug into locked vaults and awakened
        horrors from the past: <strong>Phyrexian war machines</strong> and beasts meant for a different war, a different age.
        Arcum Dagsson’s world of ingenious constructs became a disaster waiting for a command word.
      </p>

      <p>
        When those machines rose, Soldev didn’t merely lose a battle — it was destroyed. And the catastrophe didn’t stop there.
        The war-beasts were sent to the <strong>School of the Unseen</strong>, drawn toward a source of black mana and a pit whose history
        reached into darker places. The School, once a hidden refuge, became a target and then a wreck.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this chaos, <strong>Jaya</strong> and <strong>Jodah</strong> become more than famous names. Their actions decide whether a catastrophe
        becomes extinction. The Thaw forges heroes the way the Ice Age did — by refusing to allow anyone to stay uninvolved.
      </p>

      <h2>Coldsnap: the cold refuses to die quietly</h2>
      <p>
        Even after the World Spell, winter does not simply vanish. It lingers in cults, relics, undead oaths, and leaders who cannot accept
        a changing world. The <strong>Cult of Rimewind</strong> rises as a true force, armed with hatred and whatever war-machines the melting ice
        coughs up.
      </p>

      <p>
        The battles of the Thaw are not “afterstory.” They are the world’s final test: will Terisiare become something new,
        or will it be dragged back into the old freeze by those who miss the certainty of endless snow?
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s the record: a continent frozen by ancient sin, locked by planar disaster, shaped by migrating nations,
        shaken by necromancy and machines, and finally cracked open by a spell powerful enough to change the world — and then
        forced to fight for what comes after.
