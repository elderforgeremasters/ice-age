      <h1>World Lore</h1>

      <p>
        Dominaria is an Earthlike plane—spherical, with broad continents and oceans under a familiar sun—and it has two moons:
        the natural <strong>Mist Moon</strong> and the artificial <strong>Null Moon</strong>. In the Ice Age, that sun often feels muted behind heavy cloud
        and endless snowfall, so daylight turns pale and grudging, as if the world is rationing warmth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people still see the moons rise and the seasons inch along, but many swear the sky feels wrong:
        planar travel is choked off and the world’s metaphysics feel “sealed,” which makes strange omens plausible and persuasive—auroras sharper than they should be,
        constellations that seem oddly fixed in certain regions, and cult whispers that the Null Moon is watching rather than merely orbiting.
      </p>

      <p>
        The effects of the Ice Age are most felt in Dominaria's northern hemisphere, on the isolated continent of Terisiare, where the people call the Ice Age the <strong>Time of the Eternal Snows</strong>.
        A winter so long it stopped being weather and became history. Terisiare didn’t merely grow colder.
        It was reshaped, renamed, and rerouted by ice until the continent itself felt like a maze built to test survival.
      </p>

        <h2>1) The world starts freezing</h2>

        <div class="loreCard loreCard--right">
          <figure>
            <img src="cards/778-Island-of-Lat-Nam.webp" alt="Island of Lat-Nam" />
            <figcaption><strong>Island of Lat-Nam</strong> — when sea levels fall, straits become land. When the Thaw comes, the sea returns.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          The cold had been creeping in for ages, but the real turning point comes after the <strong>Sylex Blast</strong>, the apocalyptic detonation of the Golgothian Sylex—an ancient artifact designed to unleash vast, reality-scorching magic—set off by Urza at the end of the Brothers’ War.
          The world’s mana and climate both scar, and the decline accelerates until the Ice Age is no longer feared as a season but rather accepted as the new era.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glaciers advance like empires. As the <strong>Great Glacier</strong> crawls south, ocean water is pulled into ice and sea levels drop.
          The <strong>Lat‑Nam Straits</strong> disappear, connecting the former island to the mainland and exposing new terrain from beneath the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          With so much seawater locked into ice, the seas across Dominaria recede, but nowhere as much as on Terisiare. Here, glaciers bury valleys, forests, and even hidden settlements beneath tons of ice,
          until old landmarks become rumor and navigation turns into guesswork. Far to the northeast, the ancient <strong>Ronom Glacier</strong> reaches down toward
          now frozen <strong>Ronom Lake</strong>; as meltwater patterns falter, the lake’s margins sour into the <strong>Frost Marsh</strong> — a preview of how this era doesn’t
          merely freeze land, it rewrites the living world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The map doesn’t just change — it hardens. Routes become walls, coastlines become guesses, and Terisiare’s people learn that survival can hinge on whether the ice
          decides your road still exists.
        </p>

            <figcaption><strong>School of the Unseen</strong> — a refuge of magic that survives by staying quiet, warded, and relentlessly prepared.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Civilization doesn’t stop — it withdraws. When open cities become liabilities, scholarship and spellcraft move behind wards and into hidden valleys.
          The western magic tradition that began at Lat‑Nam survives the collapse of older institutions, then reforms as secret settlements and academies.
          Out of that lineage comes the <strong>School of the Unseen</strong>, first housed in the <strong>City of Shadows</strong>, and later forced to relocate as ice remakes the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          The School becomes the largest congregation of magic and artifice during the Ice Age, led for ages by <strong>Jodah, Archmage Eternal</strong>.
          Its culture is endurance: secrecy, long planning, careful recruiting, and a willingness to trade glory for survival.
          Even its scandals are strangely pragmatic — one infamous bargain relocates a <strong>bottomless pit of black mana</strong> into the School’s grounds,
          because dangerous things are sometimes easier to manage when you know exactly where they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the world grows smaller in a different way. The <strong>Shard of Twelve Worlds</strong> forms as a side‑effect of the Sylex Blast:
          nearby planes are bound into a nexus and a barrier clamps down on travel into or out of it.
          To ordinary people the consequences arrive as rumor and omen — a sky that feels “sealed,” a sense that distant forces can no longer leave (or enter),
          and the uneasy idea that whatever ancient powers are already present must now play the game with the doors locked.

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Centuries pass. The Ice Age grinds on. Then comes one of its defining tragedies: the <strong>Fall of Storgard</strong>.
          The <strong>Raynor Glacier</strong> presses down upon the kingdom, and the last king, <strong>Miko</strong>, is quietly corrupted
          by a “secret advisor” whose counsel thrives on paranoia and division.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the royal council chooses to stay even as the glacier approaches, dissent hardens into a split:
          some argue that a capital can be rebuilt, but the people cannot. Those who decide to stay, risk becoming forgotten under the new ice, and those who leave risk everything just to ensure being spared the city’s fate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The refugees eventually settle upon the ruins of old Penregon and found the city of <strong>Kjeld</strong>. What begins as flight becomes a nation: <strong>Kjeldor</strong>.
          Those who remain in Storgard are eventually swallowed by the glacier and erased. The Ice Age doesn’t just kill — it removes the evidence.

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Late in the era, Terisiare remains a continent full of hardened nations and refined magic — but it is also a place where the oldest actors still cast long shadows.
          The Shard of Twelve Worlds remains. The cold remains. And conflicts increasingly feel like proxy wars: mortals bleeding on the snow while larger hands steer the pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the <strong>Summit of the Null Moon</strong>, a group of trapped planeswalkers (the most powerful wizards who can otherwise travel between planes) convene under the promise of breaking the Shard together.
          But the meeting is poisoned by private agendas. Death strikes: the Elder Dragon <strong>Chromium Rhuell</strong> is slain, and Faralyn’s spellsquire
          <strong>Ravidel</strong> dies as well — two deaths with releases of power so violent they become fuel for escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ravidel is later restored to life, but the resurrection curdles him into obsession. Gratitude turns to rage that his dragon was not saved,
          and the summit’s failure becomes a vendetta written in frost. To the peoples of Terisiare, though, the summit is half‑myth —
          a gathering that feels like an omen in itself, proof that even “solutions” can be weapons in disguise.

        </div>

        <p>
          As the Ice Age reaches its breaking point, Terisiare erupts into its final great war. The necromancer <strong>Lim‑Dûl</strong>
          drives legions of undead through the Karplusan passes, and the defenders choose a choke point: the mouth of a main pass through the
          <strong>Karplusan Mountains</strong>, north of Krov.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two rivals form a desperate alliance. The <strong>Balduvians</strong>, led by <strong>Lovisa Coldeyes</strong>, and the <strong>Kjeldorans</strong>,
          led by <strong>General Varchild</strong>, set camp together and wait for the necromancer’s approach.
          Several mages take the field — <strong>Jodah</strong> the archmage, <strong>Jaya Ballard</strong> the taskmage, and others whose names become welded to the era’s ending —
          because this war is not only steel and courage; it is spellcraft aimed directly at shaping the world's history.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the climax, Jodah duels Lim‑Dûl. Lim‑Dûl calls on dark planeswalker <strong>Leshrac</strong> for aid — and Leshrac arrives, predictably not to save him,
          but to express disappointment in him. Lim‑Dûl’s defeat ends the war, and the site becomes known as the <strong>Last Battlefield</strong>:
          the last battle fought during the Time of the Eternal Snows.

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Immediately after Lim‑Dûl’s defeat, planeswalker <strong>Freyalise</strong> acts. She casts the <strong>World Spell</strong> to break the Shard and finally end the Ice Age.
          The ritual centers on the <strong>Ice Cauldron</strong>, a vast stone bowl of magically frosted iron inscribed with runes and set into a narrow valley like a heart in a ribcage.
          At its center lies <strong>Jodah’s Mirror</strong>, placed at the bottom of the cauldron as the focal point — an instrument meant to “show the land its true self.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The spell’s power is on par with the Sylex Blast — potentially catastrophic — so its force is dispersed through ancient “safe havens,” a secret fast-travel network of caves.
          The price is brutal: the havens are destroyed to spare the wider world, burning out like overcharged lightning rods.
          Terisiare survives the cure, but the cure leaves scars. Nevertheless, the ice loosens its grip at long last.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next era is called <strong>The Thaw</strong>, but it begins with a betrayal of expectations: warmth doesn’t arrive as peace — it arrives as water.
          Meltwater long locked in Terisiare’s great glaciers rushes out over decades and pools across the heart of the continent, forming the <strong>Sea of Laments</strong>
          and breaking old Terisiare into the <strong>Terisian Isles</strong>, which will in the future often become known as the <strong>Lost Continent</strong>.
          The old map is drowned and rewritten; some lands vanish from the record, while others emerge from retreating ice like recovered bones.

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Not long into the Thaw, melting ice reveals what should have stayed buried. In <strong>Soldev</strong>, machinists excavate relics tied to old wars —
          and among them, <strong>Phyrexian War Beasts</strong>, whale‑like engines of cable and plated copper built to eat rock and tunnel through stone.
          <strong>Arcum Dagsson</strong> becomes the great champion of the machines, convinced that constructs can defend Soldev and strengthen Kjeldor.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the machines are not neutral. Through Phyrexian possession and ritual the dark cores awaken in the War Beasts
          and turn them into levers of destruction. Jodah is drawn into the catastrophe and gravely wounded.
          Soldev is destroyed in a storm of iron and panic — proof that the Thaw can uncover dangers as easily as it uncovers land.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disaster doesn’t end with Soldev. The War Beasts are sent to the <strong>bottomless pit</strong> beneath the <strong>School of the Unseen</strong>,
          and from there they assault the School directly, triggering the event that becomes known in history as the <strong>Fall of the School of the Unseen</strong>.
          A refuge that endured the Time of the Eternal Snows is ruined by what the ice concealed — and its survivors are scattered, carrying their knowledge out into a newly opened world.

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Even after the World Spell, the cold refuses to die politely. Movements rise that want the world frozen again — not as nostalgia, but as doctrine.
          The <strong>Cult of Rimewind</strong> gathers around <strong>Rimewind Keep</strong>, led by <strong>Heidar</strong>, a cryomaster who styles himself the defender of the Boreal lands.
          To the cult, summer is not relief. It is disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Thaw creates its own temptations. As glaciers thin, old vaults and buried mechanisms become reachable — and that reachability looks like destiny to the wrong minds.
          Heidar turns his attention toward the coldest places of Terisiare and the secrets locked in ancient ice, courting machinists and hunters,
          searching for anything that can be made into an engine of winter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coldsnap</strong> is winter’s last, organized bite: not the Ice Age returning by accident, but an attempt to bring it back on purpose —
          a final reminder that ending a catastrophe is not the same thing as ending the people who thrived inside it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:2rem">
        That’s the record: a world frozen by ancient disaster, sealed by planar consequence, hardened into nations, shaken by necromancy and machines,
        cracked open by a spell powerful enough to end an era — and then tested again by those who refused to let winter go.
