      <h1>Basic Rules</h1>

      <p>
        Magic is essentially a duel between two mages. You win by reducing your opponent to
        <strong>0 life</strong> (usually through combat damage from creatures), though some cards can win
        in other ways.
      </p>

      <h2>What you need to know before your first game</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cards cost mana.</strong> Mana usually comes from lands.</li>
        <li><strong>You normally play one land per turn.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Creatures attack and block.</strong> Unblocked attackers damage the opponent.</li>
        <li><strong>Most spells happen on your turn.</strong> Instants are the fast ones.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Tap” means rotate the card.</strong>
          Tapping is shown with the tap symbol
          <img class="inlineIcon" alt="{T}" src="assets/icons/Ts.webp" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='assets/icons/Ts.png';">
          .
        </li>
        <li><strong>Always read the type line.</strong> It tells you what the card is.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to read a card by where your eyes go</h2>
      <p>
        Read a Magic card like a dashboard: identity up top, picture for vibe, rules for behavior,
        then combat stats and metadata.
      </p>

      <h3>1) Top bar: Name (left) and Mana Cost (right)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Card name</strong> is in the top-left bar.</li>
        <li><strong>Mana cost</strong> is in the top-right corner of that same bar.</li>
        <li>
          The mana cost also shows the card’s <strong>colors</strong> at a glance:
          <strong>W</strong> (white), <strong>U</strong> (blue), <strong>B</strong> (black),
          <strong>R</strong> (red), <strong>G</strong> (green).
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>number in a circle</strong> is <strong>generic mana</strong> (paid with any color).
          If the cost has only numbers / colorless symbols and no colored symbols, the card is usually
          <strong>colorless</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2) Artwork window (upper half)</h3>
      <p>
        The large picture box under the top bar is the <strong>artwork</strong>.
        It’s not rules text, but it often hints at creature type, environment, and tone.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Type line + Set symbol (strip under the art)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <strong>type line</strong> is the thin strip directly under the art (e.g., <em>Creature — Elf Warrior</em>).
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>set / expansion symbol</strong> usually sits on the <strong>right side</strong> of that same strip.
        </li>
        <li>
          On most modern frames, the symbol’s <strong>color shows rarity</strong>:
          <strong>black</strong> = common, <strong>silver</strong> = uncommon, <strong>gold</strong> = rare,
          <strong>orange/copper</strong> = mythic rare.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4) Rules text (and flavor text)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The big text box below the type line contains the <strong>rules text</strong> (what the card does).</li>
        <li>
          If present, <strong>flavor text</strong> is usually below rules text in the same box,
          often italicized and separated by spacing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5) Power/Toughness (creatures only)</h3>
      <p>
        Creature cards have a small box in the <strong>bottom-right corner</strong> showing
        <strong>Power/Toughness</strong> like <strong>3/2</strong>. Noncreature cards won’t have this.
      </p>

      <h3>6) Bottom edge (fine print row)</h3>
      <p>
        Along the bottom edge you’ll often find small-print metadata like <strong>collector number</strong>,
        <strong>artist credit</strong>, and legal/copyright text.
      </p>

      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player shuffles their deck (library) and draws <strong>5 cards</strong>.</li>
        <li>Decide who goes first (roll a die, coin flip, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Anatomy of a turn</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Untap</strong> — Untap your tapped cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Upkeep</strong> — “During your upkeep” abilities happen.</li>
        <li><strong>Draw</strong> — Draw a card (either from basic land piles or your library).</li>
        <li><strong>1st Main phase</strong> — Play a land, cast spells, activate abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Combat</strong> — Declare attackers, then blockers, then damage.</li>
        <li><strong>2nd Main phase</strong> — Cast more spells after combat.</li>
        <li><strong>End step</strong> — End-step abilities happen; damage wears off; discard down to <strong>5</strong>.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Mana and casting spells</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To cast a spell, pay its <strong>mana cost</strong> (top-right of the card).</li>
        <li>You usually pay by tapping lands for mana; lands untap at the start of your next turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Unused mana empties</strong> as steps/phases end (unless a card says otherwise).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Card types (quick model)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lands</strong> — Main mana source. Played only on your turn, usually one per turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Creatures</strong> — Stay in play. They attack/block. P/T is bottom-right (e.g., 3/2).</li>
        <li><strong>Instants</strong> — Fast spells. Cast them at almost any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Sorceries</strong> — Slower spells. Cast only during your main phase when the stack is empty.</li>
        <li><strong>Enchantments / Artifacts</strong> — Permanents that stay in play and provide ongoing effects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Combat (how damage happens)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You choose which creatures attack.</li>
        <li>Opponent chooses blockers.</li>
        <li><strong>Unblocked attackers</strong> deal damage to the opponent.</li>
        <li><strong>Blocked creatures</strong> deal damage to the creatures blocking / being blocked.</li>
        <li>
          Most creatures have <strong>summoning sickness</strong>: they can’t attack or use tap abilities the
          turn they enter play unless they have <em>haste</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stack and timing (the “response” concept)</h2>
      <p>
        When a spell is cast or an ability is activated, it goes on the <strong>stack</strong>. Players can respond.
        The stack resolves <strong>last-in, first-out</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Zones (where cards live)</h2>
      <p>
        During a game, cards move between a few standard areas called <strong>zones</strong>.
        Knowing these makes the table layout feel obvious instead of chaotic.
      </p>

      <h3>Hand</h3>
      <p>
        Cards you’ve drawn but haven’t played yet. Your hand is private unless an effect says otherwise.
      </p>

      <h3>Library</h3>
      <p>
        Your face-down deck. You draw from the top. If an effect tells you to search your library,
        you shuffle afterward (unless the effect explicitly says not to).
      </p>

      <h3>Play</h3>
      <p>
        Cards “in play” sit on the table in front of you: lands, creatures, artifacts, enchantments, etc.
        Most ongoing effects come from cards in play.
      </p>

      <h3>Graveyard</h3>
      <p>
        Your discard pile. Destroyed creatures go here. Instants and sorceries usually go here after they resolve.
        The graveyard is public information.
      </p>

      <h3>Exile</h3>
      <p>
        A separate public zone for cards removed from the game by “exile” effects. Exile is not the graveyard —
        it’s usually harder to get cards back from exile unless a card specifically allows it.
      </p>

      <h3>Stack</h3>
      <p>
        This is not a physical pile, but it’s a real zone: when you cast a spell or activate an ability,
        it goes on the <strong>stack</strong> first. Players can respond. Then it resolves last-in, first-out.
        Instants and sorceries usually go to the graveyard after resolving. Permanents resolve by entering play.
      </p>

      <h3>Quick table layout tip</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep <strong>lands</strong> in a row closest to you, creatures above them.</li>
        <li>Keep your <strong>graveyard</strong> and <strong>exile</strong> separate so you never mix them up.</li>
        <li>Keep your <strong>library</strong> in a consistent corner and always draw from the top.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>One last note</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t need to memorize everything. If you know turn structure, mana, and combat,
        you can play — the rest is learning what your cards do.
