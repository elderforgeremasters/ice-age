      <h1>Basic Rules</h1>
      <p>Magic is a duel between two mages. You win by reducing your opponent to <strong>0 life</strong> (most games), or by meeting a card’s special win condition.</p>

      <h2>What you need to know before your first game</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cards cost mana.</strong> Mana usually comes from lands.</li>
        <li><strong>You get one land play per turn.</strong> Lands don’t cost mana to play.</li>
        <li><strong>Creatures attack; creatures block.</strong> Most spells happen on your turn, but instants can happen on any turn.</li>
        <li><strong>“Tap” means rotate the card.</strong> Tapping is shown with the tap symbol <img class="inlineIcon" alt="{T}" src="assets/icons/Ts.webp" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='assets/icons/Ts.png';">.</li>
        <li><strong>Read the type line.</strong> It tells you what the card is (Creature, Instant, Land, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player shuffles their deck and draws <strong>7 cards</strong>.</li>
        <li>Decide who goes first. (Often: roll a die.)</li>
        <li><strong>Mulligan:</strong> If your hand is bad, you may reshuffle and draw 7 again, then put 1 card on the bottom for each mulligan taken.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Anatomy of a turn</h2>
      <p>Every turn has the same skeleton. Don’t panic — you’ll learn it by doing.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Untap</strong> — Untap your tapped cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Upkeep</strong> — “At the beginning of your upkeep” abilities happen.</li>
        <li><strong>Draw</strong> — Draw a card. (The starting player usually skips their first draw.)</li>
        <li><strong>Main phase</strong> — Play a land (if you haven’t), cast spells, activate abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Combat</strong> — Declare attackers, then blockers, then damage happens.</li>
        <li><strong>Main phase (again)</strong> — Cast more spells after combat.</li>
        <li><strong>End step / Cleanup</strong> — “At end step” abilities happen; damage wears off; discard down to hand size (usually 7).</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Mana and casting spells</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To cast a spell, you pay its <strong>mana cost</strong> (top-right of the card).</li>
        <li>You usually pay by tapping lands for mana. Lands stay tapped until your next untap step.</li>
        <li><strong>Unused mana empties</strong> as steps/phases end. (No saving it “for later” unless a card says you can.)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Card types (the quick mental model)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lands</strong> — Your main mana source. Played only on your turn, one per turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Creatures</strong> — Stay on the battlefield. They attack/block. Power/Toughness is bottom-right (e.g., 3/2).</li>
        <li><strong>Instants</strong> — Fast spells. Cast them any time you have priority (often in response).</li>
        <li><strong>Sorceries</strong> — Slower spells. Cast only during your main phase when the stack is empty.</li>
        <li><strong>Enchantments / Artifacts</strong> — Permanents that stay in play and provide ongoing effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Planeswalkers</strong> — Powerful permanents with loyalty abilities (use one per turn, on your turn).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Combat (how the punching works)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You choose which creatures attack and who they attack (the opponent, or sometimes planeswalkers).</li>
        <li>Opponent chooses blockers.</li>
        <li><strong>Unblocked creatures</strong> deal damage to the opponent.</li>
        <li><strong>Blocked creatures</strong> deal damage to the creatures blocking / being blocked.</li>
        <li>Most creatures have <strong>summoning sickness</strong>: a creature can’t attack or use tap abilities the turn it enters play unless it has <em>haste</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stack and timing (the one concept that makes everything click)</h2>
      <p>When a spell is cast or an ability is activated, it goes on the <strong>stack</strong>. Players can respond. The stack resolves <strong>last-in, first-out</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Instants (and abilities) can be used to respond to other spells.</li>
        <li>If nobody responds, the top thing resolves. Then players get another chance to respond.</li>
        <li>Most of the time, just remember: <strong>you can respond to what your opponent just did.</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Keywords you’ll see a lot</h2>
      <p>Your fastest path to confidence is recognizing keywords. The <a href="keyword-icons.html">Keyword Icons</a> page is your cheat sheet.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flying</strong> — blocked only by flying/reach.</li>
        <li><strong>Trample</strong> — extra damage spills over to the opponent.</li>
        <li><strong>First strike / Double strike</strong> — deals damage earlier (or twice).</li>
        <li><strong>Deathtouch</strong> — any damage is lethal to creatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Hexproof / Shroud</strong> — harder (or impossible) to target.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>One last “save your brain” note</h2>
      <p>You do <strong>not</strong> need to memorize every rule. If you know the turn structure, mana, and combat, you can play. The rest is just learning what your cards do — which is the fun part.</p>
