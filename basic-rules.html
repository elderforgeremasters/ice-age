      <h1>Basic Rules</h1>

      <p>
        Magic is essentially a duel between two mages. You win by reducing your opponent to
        <strong>0 life</strong> (usually through combat damage from creatures), though some cards can enable you to win
        in other ways.
      </p>

      <h2>What you need to know before your first game</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cards cost mana.</strong> Mana usually comes from lands.</li>
        <li><strong>You can normally play one land per turn.</strong> The number of spells you play isn't limited (but mana usually is).</li>
        <li><strong>Creatures attack and block.</strong> Unblocked attackers damage the opponent.</li>
        <li><strong>You play most spells during your turn.</strong> Instants can be played at any time (even during your opponent's turn).</li>
        <li>
          <strong>To tap means to rotate the card.</strong>
          Tapping is shown with the tap symbol
          <img class="inlineIcon" alt="{T}" src="assets/icons/Ts.webp" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='assets/icons/Ts.png';">
          .
        </li>
        <li><strong>Always read the card's type line.</strong> It tells you what the card actually is, so you know what to do with it.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>HOW TO READ A CARD</h2>

      <h2>1] Card Name and Mana Cost</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Card name</strong> is in the top-left bar.</li>
        <li><strong>Mana cost</strong> is in the top-right corner of that same bar.</li>
        <li>
          The mana cost also shows the card’s <strong>colors</strong> at a glance:
          <strong>W</strong> (white), <strong>U</strong> (blue), <strong>B</strong> (black),
          <strong>R</strong> (red), <strong>G</strong> (green).
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>number in a circle</strong> is <strong>generic mana</strong> (paid with any color).
          If the cost has only numbers / colorless symbols and no colored symbols, the card is usually
          <strong>colorless</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2] Artwork window</h2>
      <p>
        The large picture box under the top bar is the <strong>artwork</strong>.
        It is essential for establishing card's characteristics, environment, and tone.
      </p>

      <h2>3] Type line and Set symbol</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <strong>type line</strong> is the thin strip directly under the art (e.g., <em>Creature — Elf Warrior</em>).
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>set / expansion symbol</strong> usually sits on the <strong>right side</strong> of that same strip.
        </li>
        <li>
          The symbol’s <strong>color shows rarity</strong>:
          <strong>black</strong> = common, <strong>silver</strong> = uncommon, <strong>gold</strong> = rare,
          <strong>copper red</strong> = mythic rare.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4] Rules text and Flavor text</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The big text box below the type line contains the <strong>rules text</strong> (basically what the card does).</li>
        <li>
          If present, <strong>flavor text</strong> is below rules text in the same box,
          italicized, to serve as card's own lore and narrative.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5] Power/Toughness (creatures only)</h2>
      <p>
        Creature cards have a small box in the <strong>bottom-right corner</strong> showing
        <strong>Power/Toughness</strong> like <strong>3/2</strong>. Noncreature cards won’t have this.
      </p>

      <h2>6] Bottom edge (fine print row)</h2>
      <p>
        Along the bottom edge you’ll often find small-print metadata like <strong>collector's number</strong>,
        <strong>artist credit</strong>, additional card/set details and copyright text.
      </p>


      <h2>SETUP</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player shuffles their deck (library) and draws <strong>5 cards</strong>.</li>
        <li>Decide who goes first (roll a die, coin flip, whoever lost last time, etc.).</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>ANATOMY OF A TURN</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Untap</strong> — Untap your tapped cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Upkeep</strong> — When “During your upkeep” abilities happen.</li>
        <li><strong>Draw</strong> — Draw a card (either from basic land piles or your library).</li>
        <li><strong>1st Main phase</strong> — Play a land, cast spells, activate abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Combat</strong> — Declare attackers, then opponent declares blockers, then damage is dealt.</li>
        <li><strong>2nd Main phase</strong> — Cast more spells after combat if you want.</li>
        <li><strong>End step</strong> — When End-step abilities happen; damage wears off; discard down to <strong>5</strong>.</li>
      </ol>


      <h2>MANA (casting spells)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To cast a spell, pay its <strong>mana cost</strong> (top-right of the card).</li>
        <li>You usually pay by tapping lands for mana; lands untap at the start of your next turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Unused mana empties</strong> when a turn ends (unless a card says otherwise).</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>CARD TYPES (quick model)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lands</strong> — Permanent cards. Main mana source. Played only on your turn, usually one per turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Creatures</strong> — Permanent cards. They attack/block, deal combat damage, and have special abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Instants</strong> — Fast spells. Cast them at almost any time (often in response to your opponent's spells).</li>
        <li><strong>Sorceries</strong> — Slow spells. Cast only during your main phases when the stack is empty.</li>
        <li><strong>Enchantments / Artifacts</strong> — Permanent cards that provide ongoing effects.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>COMBAT (how damage happens)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You choose which creatures attack.</li>
        <li>Opponent chooses blockers and assigns them to attackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Unblocked attackers</strong> deal damage to the opponent.</li>
        <li><strong>Blocked creatures</strong> deal damage to the creatures that blocking them, and vice versa. Some creatures may die in the process.</li>
        <li>
          Most creatures have <strong>summoning sickness</strong>: they can’t attack or use tap abilities the
          turn they enter play unless they have <em>haste</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2>ZONES (where certain cards are placed)</h2>
      <p>
        During a game, cards move between a few standard areas called <strong>zones</strong>.
        Knowing these makes the table layout feel obvious instead of chaotic.
      </p>

      <h2>Hand</h2>
      <p>
        Cards you’ve drawn but haven’t played yet. Your hand is private unless an effect says otherwise.
      </p>

      <h2>Library</h2>
      <p>
        Your face-down deck. You draw from the top. If an effect tells you to search your library,
        you always shuffle afterward (unless the effect explicitly says not to).
      </p>

      <h2>Play</h2>
      <p>
        Cards “in play” are so-called permanents that sit on the table in front of you: lands, creatures, artifacts, enchantments, etc.
        Most ongoing effects come from cards in play.
      </p>

      <h2>Graveyard</h2>
      <p>
        Your discard pile. Destroyed creatures go here. Instants and sorceries usually go here after they resolve.
        The graveyard is public, meaning your opponent can look at it whenever they want.
      </p>

      <h2>Exile</h2>
      <p>
        A separate public zone for cards removed from the game by “exile” effects. Exile is different than graveyard —
        it’s usually much harder to get cards back from exile.
      </p>

      <h2>Stack</h2>
      <p>
        This is not a physical pile, but it still counts as a zone. When a spell is cast or an ability is activated, it doesn't resolve immediately, but instead goes on the so-called <strong>stack</strong>. Players can then respond with a spell or ability of their own. If they do, that goes on top of the stack, and so on.
        When no one wants to respond, the stack finally resolves <strong>last-in, first-out</strong>.
        Instants and sorceries usually go to the graveyard after resolving. Permanents usually resolve by entering play.
      </p>


      <h2>Quick table layout tip</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep <strong>lands</strong> in a row closest to you, then creatures above them.</li>
        <li>Keep your <strong>graveyard</strong> and <strong>exile</strong> separate so you never mix them up.</li>
        <li>Keep your <strong>library</strong> in a consistent corner and always draw from the top.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>One last note</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t need to memorize everything. If you know the turn structure, mana, and combat,
        you can play — the rest is more or less just learning what each individual card does, which is where the real fun part of this game starts.
