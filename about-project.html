      <h1>About the Project</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Atlantica Remasters</strong> began as a straightforward ambition: preserve the nostalgic clarity of early Magic while giving it
        the execution it always deserved. What was once a brilliant idea filtered through the constraints of its era is now treated as a world
        worth restoring with obsessive care.
      </p>

      <p>
        The remastering work keeps the original spirit—direct, readable, unpretentious—while refining the parts that time made painfully obvious:
        rules are streamlined for immersion, presentation is modernized for clarity, and power is tuned to remain faithful to original rarity while
        accounting for <span class="muted">(power creep—how average card strength has gradually risen over the decades)</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deeper purpose, however, is not merely “cleaner cards.” It is <strong>Terisiare brought to life</strong>.
        Ice Age’s setting is uniquely suited to visual excellence: immense landscape variety under icy, snow-lit skies—glacier shelves, frost marshes,
        blinding ridgelines, steel-blue storms. When a world offers that much natural drama, it is almost irresponsible not to push aesthetics to the
        limit. So the visuals are deliberately <em>maxed out</em>—not for flash, but for legibility, atmosphere, and impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Character art receives the same commitment. The Ice Age hardens posture and presence; Terisiare’s women are not “cute fantasy” decoration,
        but ice-shaped, physically striking figures—often with Nordic-leaning features and a grounded, mature allure that fits a world built on survival.
        This is a setting where beauty is not delicate; it is resilient.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every illustration is crafted to match the card’s identity—mechanics, tone, and lore—using consistent direction, natural anatomy, believable
        materials, and the cold light of Terisiare. The objective is coherence: a cube that reads like a single world, not a collage of unrelated art styles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Worldbuilding is treated as first-class content. Every card now has its own <strong>flavor text</strong>, and most cards also have a dedicated
        <strong>lore entry</strong> in this site’s database—because mechanics without world are only half the spell.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        The three card comparisons below are presented only as small, representative snapshots—examples of the kinds of refinements the remaster applies,
        not “perfect picks” and not a claim that any one card carries the entire project.
      </p>

      <!-- Example 1: text left, images right -->
      <div class="apRow">
        <div class="apText">
          <h2>Example 1 — Seraph: silhouette, clarity, and myth made readable</h2>
          <p>
            Some originals succeed by implication: a clean name, a clean presence, and a sense of myth compressed into a few lines. The remaster’s task
            is to preserve that purity while sharpening delivery—clearer hierarchy, cleaner readability, and art that anchors the figure inside Terisiare’s
            light rather than an abstract “fantasy elsewhere.” The goal is not reinvention, but <em>precision</em>: the same idea, finally landing the way it
            always wanted to.

      <p>
        As Atlantica Remasters expanded, it became clear that the Ice Age block is not simply a set of cards—it is a continent under pressure:
        nations splintering, cults rising, wars grinding forward, and secrets buried deep enough to survive centuries of snow. Restoring the block meant
        restoring its connective tissue: the names, the places, the atmosphere, and the unspoken context the originals only had room to hint at.
      </p>

      <!-- Example 2: images left, text right -->

        <div class="apText">
          <h2>Example 2 — Land Cap: refinement without inflation</h2>
          <p>
            Not every improvement is dramatic. Many of the most valuable changes are quiet: clearer intent, smoother play patterns, and a presentation that
            communicates at a glance. The remaster approach avoids “modernizing by overpowering.” Instead, it focuses on polish—templating and visual structure
            that reduce friction, while keeping the card’s role aligned with its original rarity and the environment it belongs to.

      <h2>Remaster first. Format second.</h2>
      <p>
        Terminology matters. <strong>Atlantica Remasters</strong> is the restoration work: the card pool, the art direction, the tuned mechanics, and the
        worldbuilding layer that makes Terisiare coherent and immersive.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>ElderForge</strong> is a separate creation: an independent, campaign-like play format that emerged naturally once the remastered world felt
        complete enough to be explored. It is not bound to Ice Age; it is designed to apply to future remastered blocks and worlds with minimal adaptation.
      </p>

      <p>
        ElderForge turns a remastered cube into a journey. Players advance as apprentice mages on the road to becoming planeswalkers—traveling through a setting,
        following rumors, uncovering hidden places, and facing rivals and dangerous creatures through fast, focused duels. Victory earns new cards as rewards; treasure
        yields discoveries; progress becomes tangible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Underneath it all lies the central promise of Ice Age Terisiare: the glaciers are not only a landscape, but a vault. Something enormous sleeps beneath them—
        a secret powerful enough to force Dominaria’s historians to rewrite their accounts, whether they want to or not.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        The campaign spirit draws inspiration from the classic late-90s MicroProse <em>Shandalar</em> era: roam, duel, grow stronger, and let the world itself
        be the engine of progression.
      </p>

      <!-- Example 3: text left, images right -->
      <div class="apRow">
        <div class="apText">
          <h2>Example 3 — Elvish Ranger: fidelity to species, climate, and character</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes the reason to remaster is simple: the original execution misses the identity it is meant to convey. In the original Elvish Ranger artwork,
            the figure reads more human than elf, the scene lacks Terisiare’s cold language—no snow, no ice-light, no environmental cues—and the body presentation
            leans toward an exaggerated “bodybuilder” silhouette rather than the gentler, athletic strength that fits a ranger. Even the anatomy carries cues that can
            read as artificially emphasized, which breaks immersion immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            The remaster corrects the essentials: species reads as elf; posture and composition match role; environment speaks Ice Age; and the character belongs to
            Terisiare rather than floating in generic fantasy space. This is the kind of difference that separates a mass-produced artifact from a deliberately restored
            world—one that refuses to accept “close enough.”
          </p>

          <p>
            That same restoration impulse is also why the project includes <strong>168 additional mythic rare cards</strong>: characters, events, and locations the
            original printings referenced but never fully delivered. They are designed to tie loose ends, deepen the setting, and serve as meaningful “story anchors”
            during ElderForge progression—earned moments, not random noise.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="apMedia" aria-label="Elvish Ranger comparison">
          <div class="apPair">
            <figure class="apFig">
              <img class="apImg" src="assets/images/all-88a-elvish-ranger.jpg" alt="Elvish Ranger — original 1996 print" />

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The project’s guiding philosophy is simple: if the setting is worth loving, it is worth executing properly. Atlantica Remasters treats Terisiare as a place
        that deserves maximum clarity, maximum beauty, and maximum coherence—because the world was always there. It just never got the full realization it earned.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        This is fan-made, private-playgroup craft work: lore-faithful, visually rigorous, and built to be played—the kind of restoration that exists because standards
        still matter.
