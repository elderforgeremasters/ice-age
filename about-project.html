      <h1>About the Project</h1>

      <p>
        ElderForge — Ice Age began as a love letter to early‑90s Magic: The Gathering — the mood, the names, the strange
        little rules, and that specific feeling that every card is an artifact from a world that’s bigger than the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        The original goal was straightforward: remaster the Ice Age block so it keeps its nostalgic clarity, but loses the
        rough edges that time exposed. Rules are streamlined without turning into a wall of keywords, the card frames are
        modernized, and power stays faithful to each card’s original rarity while accounting for modern baselines
        <span class="muted">(power creep — the gradual increase in average card strength over the years)</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Art is treated like rules text with a heartbeat: every illustration is <em>crafted</em> to match the card’s character,
        mechanics, and tone — consistent direction, natural materials, grounded anatomy, and Ice Age atmosphere. No CGI sheen,
        no random style whiplash. The aim is for each image to feel like it always belonged on Terisiare… just finally rendered
        with the patience it deserved.
      </p>

          <h2>Seraph — clarity without losing the myth</h2>
          <p>
            Some cards are “simple” in the best way: they read cleanly, but they carry a whole story in a few lines.
            Seraph is a perfect example — a single presence that feels like an omen. The remaster keeps that purity,
            while tightening presentation and reinforcing what the card is <em>about</em>.

      <p>
        As the remastering work expanded, something became obvious: the Ice Age block isn’t just a set of cards — it’s an
        entire continent under pressure. Terisiare has nations, grudges, migrations, cults, wars, and secrets that never fully
        fit inside a handful of booster packs. So the project didn’t stop at “better card files.” It became a deep‑dive restoration
        of the world itself.

          <h2>Land Cap — smoother play, same identity</h2>
          <p>
            A good remaster doesn’t just look sharper — it plays smoother. The goal is the same Ice Age identity, with the
            “rules friction” dialed down so games feel brisk and immersive. Cards keep their original weight in the environment,
            especially relative to rarity, but the way they communicate that weight becomes more elegant.
          </p>
          <p>
            That philosophy applies across the cube: keep the nostalgic simplicity, fix the clunk, and make sure the Limited
            ecosystem feels coherent instead of spiky.

      <h2>How ElderForge was born</h2>
      <p>
        ElderForge started as “just” a card remastering project. But once the entire block was rebuilt as a cohesive cube — with
        missing pieces restored, rough edges smoothed, and the lore expanded into something you can actually <em>travel through</em> —
        it felt natural to give the world a format that matches its scope.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s the core of ElderForge: a campaign‑style tabletop experience where players act as adventurers on their way to
        becoming planeswalkers. You explore Terisiare, follow rumors, uncover hidden places, and clash with rival mages and
        dangerous creatures through fast, mini Magic duels. Wins earn new cards as rewards. Treasure yields discoveries. Progress
        is tangible.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the while, you’re chasing the continent’s ultimate secret — something entombed deep inside the massive glaciers.
        A secret that would force Dominaria’s history writers to tear up their neat little timelines and start over.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        The campaign vibe is heavily inspired by the classic late‑90s MicroProse Shandalar game: roam, duel, grow stronger,
        and let the world itself be the progression.
      </p>

          <h2>Elvish Ranger — characters that actually feel alive</h2>
          <p>
            Ice Age is packed with characters that were introduced in a single card and then… left hanging. The remaster approach
            treats each one as a real person from a real place — not generic fantasy filler. Consistent art direction isn’t just
            a style choice; it’s how you make the world feel continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            That same impulse is why the project includes <strong>168 additional mythic rare cards</strong>: legendary figures, events,
            and locations the original printings hinted at, now designed and inserted as mythic “story anchors.” In the ElderForge
            campaign, they don’t show up as random pack luck — they arrive as earned rewards at the moments where they actually
            mean something.
