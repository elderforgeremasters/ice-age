      <h1>About the Project</h1>

      <p>
        This project began as <strong>Atlantica Remasters</strong> — a love letter to early-90s Magic: The Gathering.
        The mood, the names, the strange little rules, and that specific feeling that every card is an artifact from a world
        bigger than the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        The original goal was simple: remaster the Ice Age block so it keeps its nostalgic clarity, but loses the rough edges
        that time exposed. Rules are streamlined without turning into a wall of keywords, the card frames are modernized,
        and power stays faithful to each card’s original rarity while accounting for modern baselines
        <span class="muted">(power creep — the gradual rise in average card strength over the years)</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bigger goal, though, was always to make Terisiare <em>feel real</em> — not just “readable.” Ice Age is a gift for
        atmosphere: endless landscape variety under snowy, icy light — glacier shelves, frozen coasts, storm horizons, crystalline
        ridges. And the people who survive there carry that world in their faces and posture. Terisiare’s women, in particular,
        aren’t “cute fantasy” window dressing — they’re ice-hardened, physically striking, often with Nordic-leaning features and
        an uncommonly grounded allure: confident, mature, and formidable. Put those two together — breathtaking frozen vistas and
        that kind of presence — and the setting starts to glow.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s why the art direction is treated like rules text with a heartbeat: every illustration is meticulously
        <em>made</em> to match the card’s character, mechanics, and tone — consistent direction, natural materials, grounded anatomy,
        and true Ice Age atmosphere. No CGI sheen, no random style whiplash. The aim is for each image to feel like it always
        belonged on Terisiare… just finally rendered with the patience it deserved.
      </p>

      <p>
        The worldbuilding got the same treatment: every card now has its own <strong>flavor text</strong>, and most cards also have a
        dedicated <strong>lore entry</strong> in this site’s database — because the world matters as much as the mechanics.
      </p>

          <h2>Seraph — clarity without losing the myth</h2>
          <p>
            Some cards are “simple” in the best way: they read cleanly, but they carry a whole story in a few lines.
            Seraph is a perfect example — a single presence that feels like an omen. The remaster keeps that purity,
            while tightening presentation and reinforcing what the card is <em>about</em>.

      <p>
        As Atlantica Remasters expanded, something became obvious: the Ice Age block isn’t just a set of cards — it’s an entire
        continent under pressure. Terisiare has nations, grudges, migrations, cults, wars, and secrets that never fully fit
        inside a handful of booster packs. So the project didn’t stop at “better card files.” It became a restoration of the
        setting itself — the missing connective tissue, the implied history, the half-spoken names.

          <h2>Land Cap — smoother play, same identity</h2>
          <p>
            A good remaster doesn’t just look sharper — it plays smoother. The goal is the same Ice Age identity, with the
            “rules friction” dialed down so games feel brisk and immersive. Cards keep their original weight in the environment,
            especially relative to rarity, but the way they communicate that weight becomes more elegant.
          </p>
          <p>
            That philosophy applies across the cube: keep the nostalgic simplicity, fix the clunk, and make sure the Limited
            ecosystem feels coherent instead of spiky.

      <h2>Remaster first. Format second.</h2>
      <p>
        ElderForge came later — and it matters to separate the terms:
        <strong>Atlantica Remasters</strong> is the remastering work (the cube and its card pool).
        <strong>ElderForge</strong> is the custom Magic format built around that cube — like Commander or Vintage, but designed
        specifically for this setting and this card environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the block was rebuilt as a cohesive whole — with the originally missing pieces restored and the lore expanded into
        something you can actually <em>travel through</em> — it stopped feeling like a static collection and started feeling like a
        world that wants to be explored. At that point, a campaign-style format wasn’t a gimmick; it was the natural next step.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s the core of ElderForge: a tabletop campaign where players act as adventurers on their way to becoming planeswalkers.
        You explore Terisiare, follow rumors, uncover hidden places, and clash with rival mages and dangerous creatures through
        fast, mini Magic duels. Wins earn new cards as rewards. Treasure yields discoveries. Progress is tangible.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the while, you’re chasing the continent’s ultimate secret — something entombed deep inside the massive glaciers.
        A secret big enough that Dominaria’s history writers would have to tear up their neat little timelines and start over.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        The campaign vibe is heavily inspired by the classic late-90s MicroProse Shandalar game: roam, duel, grow stronger,
        and let the world itself be the progression.
      </p>

          <h2>Elvish Ranger — characters that actually feel alive</h2>
          <p>
            Ice Age-era sets are packed with characters who were introduced in a single card and then… left hanging.
            The remaster approach treats each one as a real person from a real place — not generic fantasy filler.
            Consistent art direction isn’t just a style choice; it’s how you make the world feel continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            That same impulse is why the project includes <strong>168 additional mythic rare cards</strong>: legendary figures,
            events, and locations the original printings hinted at, now lovingly designed as mythic “story anchors.”
            In the ElderForge campaign, they don’t show up as random luck — they arrive as earned rewards at the moments where
            they actually mean something.
