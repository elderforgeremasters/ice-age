      <h1>About the Project</h1>

      <p>
        The card remastering project under the moniker <strong>Atlantica Remasters</strong> began as a straightforward ambition: preserve the nostalgic clarity of early 1990s Magic while giving it
        the execution it always deserved. What was once just a brilliant idea filtered through the constraints of its era is now treated as a world
        worth restoring with obsessive care.
      </p>

      <p>
        The remastering work keeps the original spirit—direct, readable, unpretentious—while refining the parts that time made painfully obvious:
        rules are streamlined for immersion, presentation is modernized for clarity, and card power levels are tuned to remain faithful to original rarity while
        accounting for <span class="muted">power creep—a phenomenon of average card strength gradually rising over the decades</span>.
      </p>

      <!-- Example 1: text left, images right -->
      <div class="apRow">
        <div class="apText">
          <h2>Example 1 — Seraph: silhouette, clarity, and myth made readable</h2>
          <p>
            Some originals succeed by implication: a clean name, a clean presence, and a sense of myth. Where they fail is the presentation and an obvious struggle to compress legibility into a few lines. The remaster’s task
            is to preserve that original purity while sharpening delivery—clearer hierarchy, cleaner readability, streamlined rules, but above all, art that anchors the figure pristinely inside Terisiare’s
            light rather than an abstract “fantasy elsewhere.” The goal is not reinvention, but <em>precision</em>: the same idea, finally landing the way it
            always wanted to.

      <p>
        The deeper purpose of the restoration, however, is not merely nicer and cleaner cards. It is essentially the frozen continent of <strong>Terisiare brought to life</strong>.
        The Ice Age setting is uniquely suited to visual excellence: immense landscape variety under icy, snow-lit skies—glacier shelves, frost marshes,
        blinding ridgelines, steel-blue storms. When a world offers that much natural drama, it is almost irresponsible not to push aesthetics to the
        limit. So the visuals are deliberately <em>maxed out</em>—not for flash, but for legibility, atmosphere, and impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Character art receives the same commitment. The Ice Age inevitably hardens posture and presence; Terisiare’s women are not mere “cute fantasy” decoration,
        but instead ice-shaped, physically striking figures—often with Nordic-leaning features and a grounded, mature allure that fits a world built on survival.
        This is a setting where beauty is not only delicate; it is also resilient, and therefore lasting and evolving.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every illustration is meticulously crafted to match the card’s identity—mechanics, tone, and lore—using consistent direction, natural anatomy, believable
        materials, and the cold light of Terisiare during the Ice Age. The objective is coherence: a cube with a pool of nearly 1000 unique cards that read like a single world, not a collage of unrelated art styles.
      </p>

      <!-- Example 2: images left, text right -->
      <div class="apRow apFlip">
        <div class="apText">
          <h2>Example 2 — Land Cap: refinement without inflation</h2>
          <p>
            Not every improvement is dramatic, although it may appear that way. Many of the most valuable changes are quiet: clearer intent, smoother play patterns, and a presentation that
            communicates at a glance through uniform aesthetics rather than a “mixed bag of various art styles.” The remaster approach deliberately avoids modernizing by overpowering. Instead, it focuses on polish—templating and visual structure
            that reduce friction, while keeping the card’s role aligned with its original intent, just leveled in power to match the original rarity and inserted into the environment it belongs to.

      <p>
        Worldbuilding is treated as first-class content. Every remastered card now has its own <strong>flavor text</strong>, even if there wasn't enough space to print it on the card, the flavor exists in this site's card database, and most cards also have a dedicated
        <strong>lore entry</strong> in there as well—because mechanics without the world are really only half the spell.
      </p>

      <!-- Example 3: text left, images right -->
      <div class="apRow">
        <div class="apText">
          <h2>Example 3 — Elvish Ranger: fidelity to species, climate, and character</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes the original execution missed the identity it was meant to convey. Portrayal of the wrong species,
            lack of suitable lighting, no environmental cues, and even body presentations
            leaning toward artificially emphasized silhouettes rather than natural body shapes.
            Seemingly small errors like this break immersion immediately in a jarring way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The remaster corrects the essentials: species read correctly; postures and compositions match roles; environment speaks Ice Age; and the characters belongs to
            Terisiare rather than floating in generic fantasy space. This is the kind of difference that separates a mass-produced product from a deliberately restored
            world—one that refuses to accept “close enough.”

      <p>
        As the remastering project expanded, it became clear that the Ice Age block is not simply three sets of cards—Dominaria is a living, breathing planet, and its continent Terisiare is under constant pressure:
        nations splintering, cults rising, wars grinding forward, and secrets buried deep enough to survive millennia of snow. Restoring the entire block meant
        also restoring its connective tissue: the names, the places, the atmosphere, and the unspoken context the originals only had room to hint at.
      </p>

      <p>
        That same restoration impulse is also why the project includes <strong>168 additional mythic rare cards</strong> designed from scratch: characters, events, and locations the
        original printings referenced but never fully delivered. They are designed to tie loose ends, deepen the setting, and serve as meaningful mythic “story anchor” rewards
        earned during ElderForge campaign progression—new cards meant to be inserted as earned moments, not random noise.
      </p>

      <h2>ElderForge - A new MTG play format</h2>

      <p>
        Terminology matters. <strong>Atlantica Remasters</strong> is the moniker used exclusively for restoration work: the card pool, the art direction, the tuned mechanics, and the
        worldbuilding layer that makes worlds like Dominaria (and its continent Terisiare) coherent and immersive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, <strong>ElderForge</strong> is a separate creation born out of the sheer success of Atlantica Remasters. ElderForge is an independent, campaign-like play format that emerged naturally once the remastered world felt
        complete enough to be explored. It is not bound to Ice Age; it is designed to be easily applied to any future remastered blocks and worlds with minimal adaptation.
      </p>

      <p>
        ElderForge essentially turns a remastered cube into a journey. Players advance as apprentice mages on the road to becoming planeswalkers—traveling through the cube’s setting,
        following rumors, uncovering hidden places, and facing rivals and dangerous creatures through fast, focused Magic duels. Victory earns new cards as rewards; treasure
        yields unique discoveries; adventure progress becomes tangible and exciting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Underneath it all usually lies the central promise of the world setting: the land is not only a landscape, but a vault. An ancient secret, buried beneath—
        powerful enough to force historians to rewrite their history books, whether they want to or not.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        The campaign spirit draws inspiration from the classic late 90s MicroProse PC game <em>Shandalar</em>: roam, duel, grow stronger, and let the world itself
        be the engine of progression.
      </p>
	  
      <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
      
	  <p>
        The project’s guiding philosophy is simple: if the setting is worth loving, it is worth executing properly. Atlantica Remasters treats original Magic worlds as places
        that deserve maximum clarity, maximum beauty, and maximum coherence. The worlds invented by Richard Garfield were always there—they just never got the full realization they deserve.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        The result is this fan-made, completely independent, self-funded crafting masterpiece: 100% lore-faithful, visually rigorous, and built to be played in the most immersive way imaginable—the kind of restoration that exists only because standards
        still matter to at least one person, even in today’s world of shallow spectacle, hype-surfing, and disposable confidence.
